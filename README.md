This was a project that I thought of for learning C. Although
I had some experience with C++ from my course in DSA, I figured to stick to the true 
roots of modern software engineering and understand how 99.999% of modern software
works and how they are interfaced with hardware.

This project serves as an introduction for me to C. After this, I plan on learn on 
socket programming so that I can build my own server written in C.
